Reff = effective radius


|| FORMULAS || 
💡 i represents a single particle

* air resistance -> -6πMuRᵢvᵢ,
	> where -6πMu is constant
	📚 the greater size and speed of a particle, the greater the air resistance

* collisions (repulsion) -> (⅔Ẽ√(Reff)hᵢⱼ(⅔))řᵢⱼ,
	> where Ẽ = E/(1-ν²),
		> where E is Young's modulus (measuring stiffness of a material)
		> and ν is Possion's ratio (ratio of transverse contraction -- deformation of a solid body)
	> where Reff = RᵢRⱼ/(Rᵢ+Rⱼ)
	> where hᵢⱼ = Rᵢ + Rⱼ - |->Sᵢⱼ|
		> where ->Sᵢⱼ = ->Sᵢ - ->Sⱼ
		📚 if the distance between centers is less than the sum of both radii (overlap), collision occurs 
	> where řᵢⱼ = rᵢⱼ/|rᵢⱼ| (normal vector of contact plane)
